= Developer Friendly =

The plugin provides utility functions for developers:

* `wpmn_get_network_sites_count($network_id)` - Get site count for a network
* `wpmn_user_can_access_network($user_id, $network_id)` - Check user permissions
* `wpmn_get_network_display_name($network_id)` - Get formatted network name

The plugin is fully translatable and includes:
* English (default)
* Chinese Simplified (zh_CN)
* More languages coming soon!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with regular WordPress Multisite? =

This plugin is specifically designed for WP Multi Network environments. While it can detect regular multisite installations, the network switching functionality requires the WP Multi Network plugin to be installed and configured.

= Can I customize the network display names? =

Yes! The plugin uses the "Site Name" setting from each network's configuration. You can change this in Network Admin ‚Üí Settings for each individual network.

= How do I hide the network switcher for certain users? =

The network switcher only appears for users with `manage_network` capability. You can customize this by using WordPress capability management plugins or custom code.

= Does this plugin affect site performance? =

No, the plugin is designed with performance in mind. It uses WordPress caching to store network statistics and only loads when the admin bar is displayed.

= Can I translate this plugin to my language? =

Absolutely! The plugin is fully internationalized. You can find translation files in the `/languages/` directory. We welcome community translations on our GitHub repository.

= Is this plugin compatible with other admin bar plugins? =

Yes, the plugin is designed to work alongside other admin bar modifications. It adds its own menu item without interfering with existing functionality.

= What happens if I deactivate WP Multi Network? =

The plugin will gracefully detect the absence of WP Multi Network and won't display the network switcher. No errors or conflicts will occur.
